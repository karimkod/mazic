Notice that the size of the maze (number of grids) is always a multiple of 3 + 1 (that one is for the last border wall).

The whole system is based on 3 multipliers because the cell is made of 4 small grids and the smallest wall has 3 grids

2 cell border wall and one center wall which is shared between two walls.
